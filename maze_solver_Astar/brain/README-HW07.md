I improved the mapping from HW6 by initializing the position with an average of
the readings. Then I use the velocity to estimate the other x and y coordinates
throughout. I adapted the geeksforgeeks astar algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/. The robot wall follows when in a certain range
and when outside of this range, it matches the trajectory angle and goes 
straight once it has matched it to a certain range.
